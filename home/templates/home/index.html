                <p>I'm Sofie Heinsvig and I'm a big beliver in dreams, and trying to change the world into what we wish
                    it could be.
                    Now some might call me naive, but I firmly belive the arts is capable of doing just that.
                    It might just be the art of paint splattering on a canvas,
                    make believe on a stage and storytelling through the emotion of a photograph,
                    but then again what is life if not a collection of stories? Of emotions felt?
                    So what could be more capable of changing the world and our lives if not the stories we tell?
                    That's what I've chosen to do with my life. Changing the world, or atleast my own, one story at the
                    time.</p>

            <p>I can't remember a time when playing around with paint wasn’t my favorite thing to do.
                That, playing around, eventually started to turn from doodles on paper,
                to murals on my bedroom walls and paint splattered canvases everywhere.
                And now some of those canvases have ended up here, for you to take take a look at!
                And should any of them happen to catch your eye, then I’m usually easily convinced to part with
                them.
                After all that would clear up more wall space in my own home for new artworks to be made!</p>
